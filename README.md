# AspireIQ Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Suggestions and ideas

* show the searched text marked in black, in each result of the list.
* Add the close icon in the error scenario. ie: the error icon can be replaced with the close icon when the item is hovered.
* Keep the results list aligned to the left.
* Change the cursor to "pointer" when the list items are hovered.
* Remove selected emails from the recipients list.
* Hide picked emails from the input when the max width is reached, and show a "+" with left recipients amount.
